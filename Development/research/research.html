                <h3 style="color:#551A8B">The Logo</h3>
                   <p> The inspiration for the logo has been minimalism and elegance. The logo stands for its company name (Bumble Printer) and the first letter i.e overlapping of the B and P from Bumble and Printers serves as the brand logo on the printers. The logo was designed first on paper first and then converted digitally to get the image of the logo. The logo was initially made on procreate and for the final product, it was then proceeded to canva where the final work of creation was done. The font-family used for the logo is  'Maharlika' with no styles included. For the logo, the B and P are blended with perfection to become the main attraction of the logo.

                        <h3><a href="../HOME/newhome.html">The Homepage</a></h3>
                        <p>The homepage features a banner for the user to experience our welcome listing out our main feature, color accuracy. The image of the mountain in the background was taken from pexels, a website sharing stock free images with no royalties. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">(pexels.com)</a>Then the image was processed in Canva with all the texts and edits and the image was made ready for the banner. The banner was brought to life after contrasting its simple color palette with popping font colors on the word 'Color' itself. The second banner of "Winter Sale" was also created in a similar way in Canva. The theme was dark so the background was set to black to blend in with the website. The text elements were put to pop out for the user to be attentive towards the sale banner.</p>

                        <p>The products page was created to feature eight total products from the company's lineup. The products however, arent our very own products. The main product images and models were featured from Epson printers.<a href="https://epson.com/">(Epson.com)</a> The product details page also features the same images from the epson printers. All the models have been derived from epson printers. However, the product page and details page was entirely made by ourselves.

                        <p>The about us and contact us page was entirely created by ourselves. The page is simple and elegant for an easy experience for the user. The about us page features the CV reports of the team members. The report consists of all the qualifications and certifications of the members of the team. However, the CV is only a dummy and doesn't relate to real-life certifications of our members. The contact page also follows the theme of the about us page. The form of the contact page was created using JavaScript which is fully functional. This too was created entirely by ourselves.</p>
